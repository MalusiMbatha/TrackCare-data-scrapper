# TrackCare-data-scrapper
This VBA script automates data extraction from the NHLS TrakCare WebView portal. It logs into the site using Internet Explorer, prompts the user to apply filters, then retrieves patient table data (e.g. names, MRN, DOB, hospital details) and writes it into an Excel workbook. It handles multiple pages and closes the browser once complete.
